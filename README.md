# ICue-AI

ICue-AI is a project developed for the GDSC Plot2Deploy Hackathon. It leverages Google Gemini for generative AI and NLP to assist users in identifying dates, events, deadlines for projects and assignment submissions, as well as deadlines for registrations of various events from WhatsApp chats. The app seamlessly integrates with the user's Google Calendar to ensure they never miss important events.
